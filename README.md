## Education
---
- ### University of Tehran | 2017-2020
  ##### M.S in Analogue Integrated Circuits 
- ### University of Guilan | 2013-2017
  ##### B.S in Electrical Engineering 
  #### Last 60 credits GPA = 16.02/20
- ### Farzanegan High School | 2009-2013
  #### Affilited with National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents
  ##### Diploma in Mathematics and Physics Discipline

## Research Interests
---
I mainly prefer to work on projects as intersections of neuroscience and ML, hopefully those that work on improving methods to control and predict neurodegenerative diseases stage and severity. Right now I'm involved in a project at the UBC University to work on Parkinson's Disease EEG prediction.

## Skills
----
As a DL lover, I have good hands on coding with ***Python***, ***Octave***, ***Matlab***, and a teeny tiny experience using ***Juilia*** which I'm eager to work more with it. Mainly ***Python*** is my first choice, as I have access to more DL libraries such as ***Tensorfelow***, ***Keras***, ***Pytorch*** , and I can also do research in Neuroimaging using ***Nifti*** ,and ***Dicom***. To be totally fluent in DL and ML topics, I not only have passed ***Statistics*** during my B.S. but I also have reviewed some certified courses like ***Statistics*** and ***Linear Algebra*** in online platforms like Udemy and Coursera. Previously, during being an Electrical Engineering student, I have plenty of experiences to work with ***ARM*** and ***AVR*** microprocessors, besides using ***FPGA*** and ***VHDL*** programming, using ***Quartus*** and ***Modelsim***. I can somehome consider myself a codeaholic person, whom sometimes prefer to code for the simplest routine task of life, as a hobby.

## Publications and Talks
------
- I had the opportunity to give a talk in NMC-03 which was titled **"Enhancing classication of autism spectrum disorder using resting-state fMRI with machine learning approach and dimensionlity reduction"**, that was a group work with help of three other friends of mine: Parisa Daj Khosh, Mehrnaz Hosseinzadeh, Yousef Ghanbari. You can see the talk [here](http://url3538.neuromatch.io/ls/click?upn=Y9JGnHmpzDEHL6iaqkHsfjk0y7VSXYTlNoc4z22PQUpAHmcJb3VM88BxEGhX1gZYgW78BSlIQkWeP84kTcJpfQ-3D-3D0UC1_3iBWlz4TiEHNJGCWeA-2BcLba5IgwrA4kfGYnn3vAjgXnHy-2B2A04N5oAcYxb0Ljji-2BhFE4vqJG8fCOmhRK2HcEo4bW9sHbMqHcVkNApMj81SqglYYCMr8Wq3KI23z-2FGGnDw3P1IwVXGtigZy6uXyi22rQgM4eLaioMURgIaVQv6Ab4ZXmiuHXu6kTr2Qwkq-2FNOg33WO-2FE5SffI13GwC-2FwbtkcPfRWJT-2FoZTbQuqWZgMtVf5od4X2DEKDvmHoShWgIlh4LJBcwEzqNUrJc20IDZHA-3D-3D).
- As a new experience, I had the chance to work with a group of scientist at University of British Columbia to work on Parkinsonian on and off medication cases' EEG, in order to predict EEG for longer than 200 ms timepoints and to investigate the spatio-temporal behavior of each channel and to see the effect of getting medication on each patient. The project is still under research in order to publish it in Frontiers by the end of September (hopefully). The initial name of the paper is **"Investigation of Spectral,Temporal, and Spatial EEG Predictability using independent RNN."**
- I also am a co-author to a *"to be submitted soon"* paper which is titled **"Hybrid Black Hole algorithm based on a stochastic Markov chain model"**, the first author is Saber Yaghoobi, Phd student at the University of Reno, Nevada, and the third author is Professor Sami M.Fadali from Electrical Engineering department of University of Reno, Nevada.

## Notable Projects
----
- **Comparing the temporal dynamics of EEG of Parkinsonian’s vs. Healthy Brain**
- ##### This is a very recent project that I started to collaborate with a great team at the UBC University. We are trying to do prediction on EEG data for more than 200ms and by then we can observe and track each patient's behavior to catch wether PD on medication behavior is close to Healthy Control ones or not.

- **MRI Dementia Severity Classification**
- ##### This is a project we did as a group in Bou-Ali University-Hamedan, Iran, datascience competition, based on MRI images that were gathered from Iran Brain Mapping Bank (IBMB). Although the competition is over we still are working on the project and perform it better.
